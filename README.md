# LangChain-QA-Demo

This repository demonstrates a simple Question & Answer (Q&A) chatbot application built using the LangChain framework, Hugging Face Hub, and Streamlit. The application allows users to input questions and receive responses generated by a Hugging Face model.

## Features

- **LangChain Integration**: Utilizes the LangChain framework for building applications with language models.
- **Hugging Face Hub**: Leverages the `google/flan-t5-large` model for text-to-text generation.
- **Streamlit UI**: Provides an interactive web-based interface for user input and response display.
- **Environment Variable Management**: Uses `python-dotenv` to manage API keys securely.
